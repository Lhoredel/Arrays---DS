# Arrays---DS
This code solves the Arrays - DS problem by reversing an array in-place using two pointers. It starts with pointers at both ends and swaps elements while moving toward the center until they meet. This approach efficiently reverses the array with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
